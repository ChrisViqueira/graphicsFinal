# graphicsFinal

Making a repository for a project worked on during my senior year.
  The user can control a block person who interacts with the environment. There is very basic, hardcoded, collision detection with the one structure in the environment, and the ground. The character can walk, run, and fly.

In the future, going to switch from using GLUT to SDL and doing all around refactoring of the code to make it neater and work better.
